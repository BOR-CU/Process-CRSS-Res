## Process CRSS Results

The following attempts to document the process used in the May CRSS run to compute all 
results. 

**Warning:** the code aggregates data from 30 individual CRSS runs. This can be memory intensive.
The aggregating code was run on a computer with 48GB of memory. There is not guarantee 
that the same aggregating code will work on a PC. 

1. Aggregate necessary data
  1. Append EOCY 2015 elevations from MTOM onto Mead/Powell EOCY elevations
2. Create figures/tables
  1. provide numbers behind figures, where necessary 
  
## Tables and Figures
  
* System conditions table
  * Trim to 5-years for PPT
  * Provide table through 2026 to Modeling Team(s)
* Standard CRSS results
  * Mead/Powell EOCY elevations
  * Percent traces < 3490 
  * Percent traces in Shortage and Surplus
* Critical elevation thresholds
  * Percent traces < 3490 
  * Percent of traces < 1025, 1020, 1000
  * Percent of traces in LB Shortage and Level 3 shortage
