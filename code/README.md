## Files Used In Creating the May 2015 CRSS Results
**main.R** is the script used to process all of the results at once. It relies on:
* makeScenNames.R
* getSysCondData.R
* dataTaggingFunctions.R
* getEOCYData.R
* plottingFunctions.R
* getCondProbs.R
* plotFirstYearShortCond.R

The remaining files may have been used in April or earlier runs.
